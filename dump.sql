Samtidigt som mer än 2.000 personer från Europa hade begett sig till Lausitz-området i östra Tyskland för att protestera mot Vattenfalls förehavanden pågick aktioner mot oljeraffinaderier i USA och aktiviteter var planerade eller hade redan ägt rum på andra kontinenter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI Lausitz började det hela i fredags med att runt 1.600 aktivister ockuperade brunkolsdagbrottet Welzow Süd.Vattenfall hade dagen innan lagt ned kolbrytningen över helgen och polisen bedrev en så kallat de-eskalerande taktik för att undvika direkt konfrontationer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n– Det är också omöjligt för oss att skydda ett så stort område från intrång, dessutom är rasrisken stor i dagbrotten och vi måste tänka på säkerheten för våra poliser, säger Ines Filohn på polisen i Cottbus till DN.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPå lördagen kom det dock till en våldsam konfrontation när 300 aktivister rev ned staketet runt kraftverket Schwarze Pumpe och trängde in på området. En väktare skadades och två aktivister fördes till sjukhus, 130 personer greps och omhändertogs över natten.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnder lördagen hade några aktivister dessutom blockerat järnvägsrälsen för att stoppa kolleveranserna kraftverket Schwarze Pumpe.Vattenfall beslutade att dra ned på produktionen för att åtminstone kunna garantera värmeförsörjningen till de närbelägna städerna Hoyerswerda och Spremberg.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.\r\nHe lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided\r\nby arches into stiff sections.</b><p>\r\n<p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
