    (231, 'What makes us happy', '<p class=\"abstract\">\r\n\t\t\tUlf Bengtsson har tidigare hävdat att han inte var direkt delaktig i\r\n\t\t\tatt ge de råd som låg till grund för landshövdingen i Skånes kritiserade beslut.\r\n\t\t\tMen efter att landshövdingen själv sagt till DN att hon fick råden från\r\n\t\t\tBengtsson så har han backat från sitt tidigare uttalande.\r\n\t\t\tNu hävdar Ulf Bengtsson att han inte minns om han gett något råd, men säger\r\n\t\t\tatt det är möjligt att han gjort det. Även det reagerar KU-ordföranden Andreas Norlén starkt på.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Lycka</a> är ett ämne som alltid har gäckat människan. Redan de gamla grekiska\r\n\t\t\tfilosoferna Aristoteles och Platon lade sina pannor i djupa veck i frågan om\r\n\t\t\tvad det är som gör oss <a href=\"#\">lyckliga</a>.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tDet framstår som ett nytt intresse men Aristoteles var lyckoforskare, allt\r\n\t\t\thandlade om hur vi skulle skapa oss det goda livet och vad är det för förutsättningarna\r\n\t\t\tför detta, säger idéhistorikern <a href=\"\">Johan Norberg</a>, som bland annat har skrivit har skrivit\r\n\t\t\ten bok om jakten på lycka.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tFrågan må vara över tusen år gammal men för många kvarstår den än: Hur blir man lyckligare?\r\n\t\t\tFilip Fors, forskare vid Umeå universitet, har studerat vilka faktorer\r\n\t\t\tsom gör oss lyckligare.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>Var du bor i världen</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>Jobbet</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>Relationer</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>Pengar</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"aewrgegr\">Hur du tänker kring motgångar</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Var du bor i världen</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tEn viktig faktor är var i världen man bor, enligt Filip Fors. Människor som bor i\r\n\t\t\texempelvis Sverige är ganska lyckliga i jämförelse med personer i många andra länder i\r\n\t\t\tvärlden. Det handlar om trygghet, god hälsa och att vi lever i ett samhälle med hög\r\n\t\t\ttillit till institutioner och varandra, menar han.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tI Skandinavien är folk väldigt lyckliga jämfört med de flesta andra regioner i världen.\r\n\t\t\tDet tror man beror på att vi dels har en hög materiell levnadsstandard och låg fattigdom,\r\n\t\t\tmen också att vi bor i trygga samhällen rent socialt. Man kan lita på de flesta människor\r\n\t\t\toch vi har låg korruption och så vidare, säger Filip Fors.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Jobbet</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tVar man är uppväxt och har sitt hem är för många inte det lättaste att förändra.\r\n\t\t\tMen även vilket yrke vi har är viktig sak som bidrar till hur lyckliga vi är, enligt Filip Fors.\r\n\t\t\tEtt jobb där man får använda sina styrkor påverkar vårt välbefinnande, menar han.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMen om man inte kan finna ett meningsfullt arbete så kan det handla om att hitta något på\r\n\t\t\tfritiden som ger meningsfullhet. Man har sett att människor som har en mer aktiv fritid,\r\n\t\t\tbåde socialt och fysiskt, är lyckligare än dem som har en mer passiv fritid, säger Filip Fors.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Relationer</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tRelationer är också viktiga för välbefinnandet. Att ha ett rikt socialt liv gör att vi blir\r\n\t\t\tlyckliga, enligt lyckoforskningen. Vännerna betyder mycket för att man ska roligt och umgås,\r\n\t\t\tmen det är lika mycket ett socialt stöd. Forskningen visar även att människor som lever i\r\n\t\t\tparrelationer har något lyckligare än singlar, om än marginellt.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tDå behöver man kompensera med att ha bra vänskapsrelationer och bra relationer med familjen,\r\n\t\t\tsäger Filip Fors.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSå en lycklig singel är en person som även har ett rikt social liv?\r\n\t\t\t– Exakt. De som inte har en partner och umgås med och har få vänner är i regel olyckliga.\r\n\t\t\tDet finns självklart undantag, men i genomsnitt så är det så.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Pengar</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tEn god ekonomi är också en viktig faktor för lycka, enligt Filip Fors. Däremot är sambandet\r\n\t\t\tmellan pengar och lycka inte linjärt. Nyttan av att ha pengar avtar när man väl har uppnått\r\n\t\t\ten viss ekonomisk standard, menar han.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tDå har man sina basbehov tillfredställda. Man vänjer sig till slut vid att ha råd till mer saker,\r\n\t\t\tsäger han och lägger till att samma princip gäller för materiella ting.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tEn sak som ger är positivt för välbefinnandet är ”prosocial konsumtion”, alltså att ge pengar till välgörenhet.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Hur du tänker kring motgångar</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tNågot som kan tyckas mer diffust, men som har stor inverkan på hur lyckliga är, handlar om ens\r\n\t\t\tpersonliga egenskaper och hur man uppfattar olika saker, enligt Fors. Lyckoforskningen handlar\r\n\t\t\tå ena sidan om hur tillfreds människor är med sina liv, å andra sidan om den varaktiga känslan\r\n\t\t\tav välbefinnande. Mycket tyder på att personlighetsdrag i hög grad är genetiskt betingade.\r\n\t\t\tDäremot pekar allt mer på att det går att lära sig att hantera motgångar i livet, och därmed behålla känslan av lycka.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tVissa personer har lättare att gå vidare och uppskatta livet igen medan andra fastnar i ett negativt tänkande.\r\n\t\t\tÄr man en person som har lätt att fastna i negativa tankar så kan man gå i terapi eller använda sig av olika självhjälpstekniker, säger Filip Fors.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tHur skulle då Aristoteles och de andra grekiska tänkarna se på hur vi söker lycka i dag?\r\n\t\t\tEnligt Johan Norberg skulle frågan dela de tidiga filosoferna.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tTittar man på Aristoteles så hittar man ganska så jämförbara saker med vad de som ägnar sig\r\n\t\t\tåt frågan talar om i dag. Han precis som många andra var empirisk i sin syn.\r\n\t\t\tSedan har det funnits de som nedvärderat strävan på lycka, och sett det som något som kommer efter jordelivet,\r\n\t\t\tsäger han och fortsätter:\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tJag vill poängtera att lyckoforskningen i dag inte är en ny konstig trend, utan vi är nu tillbaka till huvudfåran i idéhistorien.\r\n\t\t\t</p>', '2016-08-10 20:38:21');
